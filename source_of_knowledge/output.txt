Avoid toxic relationships. Just avoid them. They ruin people's lives. They'll ruin your life. Like just do your best to be in healthy relationships and then everything's good. And I don't say that lightly. Like, that's a big one. I've seen so many people who were doing great, but because they got caught up in some drama, they just nose dived the whole thing.
